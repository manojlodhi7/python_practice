Dear manoj


I am writing this to request you for an extension on the XYZ project report which is due on {date}. My mother has taken ill unexpectedly, and I must leave for home tonight. Iâ€™m afraid it will take me a week before I can return to the office and complete the report.

Kindly grant me an extension till {date} for the same. I promise to deliver the project report by then.

Sincerely,
BOSS
